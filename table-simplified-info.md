# Comprehensive fu'ivla form

CLL section 4.7 defines the morphology of fu'ivla. They are brivla that are not gismu or lujvo and that satisfy the other 4 criteria. This effectively means that fu'ivla consist of valid ‘y’-less brivla with either 1) a consonant/vowel cluster that cannot appear in lujvo (this is why stage 3 fu'ivla are necessarily fu'ivla: the 4th, 5th, and 6th letters are consonants, but (section 4.1) no valid _initial_ consonant pair starts with ‘r’, ‘n’, or ‘l’, and in lujvo consonant triples must have both pairs be valid _initial_ consonant pairs (i.e. what section CLL 4.1 denotes as ‘CC’ rather than ‘C/C’) (see CLL section 3.7 and also CLL section 4.7's 2 ‘triple’ sentences), but fu'ivla do not have this restriction), or 2) including, if hyphenization is ignored, the right cv form, with 1 of the 4 normal fu'ivla forms (v, ccc, ccvv, and cvcv), either at the beginning or with a prefix that has the right rafsi decomposition parser state (one that leaves no possibility of a valid rafsi decomposition, by following the reductions listed in the table), according to the table, or 3) ending in 1 of the 4 fu'ivla tail forms (c, cv, cc, ccvcc) (only ‘cv’ ends in ‘v’, so only it is conseqential for fu'ivla determination), if hyphenization is ignored.

- `->` denotes a simplifying reduction, possibly to the empty string.
- `*` denotes more input is needed, or else there is no lujvo rafsi decomposition.
- `(…)` denotes a fu'ivla form: there exists no lujvo rafsi decomposition.
